We reach out to children from the Marikina Heights community and teach them supplementary English, Mathematics, and life skills. It is our goal to help them academically, with  fun and interactive modules, to empower them and boost their confidence as individuals. Learning is not limited to the classroom; hence, different opportunities to learn are given:  field trips and alternative class programs. We promote education as a right and not a privilege, since people are more empowered when given equal opportunities. We advocate for awareness of the power of education not only for the children in our partner communities, but also to the Loyola Schools community.",

With the looming problems in our educational system, we reach out to the youth in the Marikina Heights Community and not just provide fun learning experiences, but encourage them to use their voice and take up space in society.",

We at Project LAAN believe this can be done through our advocacy of public health.    Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where health is at the center of attention, it is important for individuals to have general knowledge of public health, for communities to be aware and assert their rights on health, and for society to uplift one another in times of need through this knowledge.     As Project LAAN approaches its 10th year as an organization, the journey towards universal health coverage has just begun.
